(CNN)Here's a look at the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, postponed until 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak. The games took place July 23-August 8, 2021. The Paralympics took place August 24-September 5, 2021. Facts This is the second time the Olympics will be held in Tokyo, which previously hosted the Games in 1964. Tokyo led an unsuccessful bid to host the 2016 Olympics. The 1972 and 1998 Winter Games were also hosted by Japan, in Sapporo and Nagano, respectively. Venues and Sports Maps Invitations to the games were sent to countries, states and territories represented by 206 National Olympic Committees and to the Refugee Olympic Team. Design and Construction The Japanese government originally selected British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid to design Tokyo's new National Stadium, though the project was later given to architect Kengo Kuma following high-profile criticisms and spiraling costs. Kuma sourced more than 70,000 cubic feet of timber from each of the country's 47 prefectures for the stadium. "We wanted to create something that captures the people's thoughts on the environment or the Earth at the time," Kuma told CNN in an interview in June 2019. Athletes competing in the games will sleep on bed frames made of cardboard and mattresses made of plastic to reduce the event's carbon footprint, according to organizers.
