Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been a prominent figure throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, is planning to retire by the end of President Joe Biden's first term, he told CNN on Monday. Fauci, 81, is no stranger to leading the federal response to national health emergencies. Since 1984, he has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci has served under seven US presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan, and in 2008 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As the nation's top infectious disease expert, Fauci has worked on the federal response to AIDS, Ebola, the Zika virus and anthrax scares, just to name a few.
