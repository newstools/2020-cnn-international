Embattled journalist Maria Ressa, a prominent critic of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, has been awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize along with Dmitry Muratov, a Russian newspaper editor. On Friday, the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo cited their "courageous fight for freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia." The Committee went on to say Ressa "uses freedom of expression to expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country, the Philippines." Ressa is the co-founder and editor of online news site Rappler, which has gained prominence for its unflinching coverage of Duterte and his brutal war on drugs. She has been indicted multiple times on libel and tax-evasion charges that critics say are designed to silence independent media in the southeast Asian country. Before starting Rappler in 2012, she worked for CNN.
